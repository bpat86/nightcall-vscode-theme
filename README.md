# Nightcall ðŸŒƒ

A mellow, but colorful VS Code dark theme with vibrant shades of pink and purple.

My goal was to make a theme versatile enough to use any time of day that could better enable me to <s>stare at broken bits of code for hours at a time while contemplating a possible career change</s> work hard on so many very important things.

## Separate the Editor from the Sidebar

Taking a page from [Night Owl's](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) book, er, theme, if you'd prefer more constrast between the editor and sidebar, paste this into your user settings. These are my color recommendations:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "[Nightcall]": {
    "contrastBorder": "#181D36",
    "activityBar.background": "#0B0E1A",
    "activityBar.border": "#181D36",
    "sideBar.background": "#0F1221",
    "sideBar.border": "#181D36",
    "list.inactiveSelectionBackground": "#0F1221",
    "tree.indentGuidesStroke": "#181D36",
    "sideBarSectionHeader.background": "#0F1221"
  },
  "[Nightcall (No Italics)]": {
    "contrastBorder": "#181D36",
    "activityBar.background": "#0B0E1A",
    "activityBar.border": "#181D36",
    "sideBar.background": "#0F1221",
    "sideBar.border": "#181D36",
    "list.inactiveSelectionBackground": "#0F1221",
    "tree.indentGuidesStroke": "#181D36",
    "sideBarSectionHeader.background": "#0F1221"
  }
}
```

## Recommended Settings

The font I'm using in the preview images is `Dank Mono` and is available [here for purchase](https://dank.sh/). For those not interested in buying a fancy font with cool italics, `Fira Code` also looks pretty good and can be downloaded [here for free](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "Dank Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.letterSpacing": 0.3,
```

## Misc

This is my first theme and there are many languages and parts of VS Code I don't use often or at all, so needless to say I might've missed a few things ðŸ˜…. Feel free to file an issue if something doesn't appear intentional on my part, or very "Nightcall-sy" if you will.

Accessibility considerations and prolific use of italics inspired by Sarah Drasner's [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) theme.

_Possible TODO item: Add a "muted" color theme option._
